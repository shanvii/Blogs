Hello, fellow coders! ðŸŒŸ

As a Master's student in Computer Science, I've been diving deep into the world of version control with Git and GitHub. It's been an enlightening experience, and I wanted to share some of the essential commands and concepts I've learned. Whether you're a newbie or just brushing up on your skills, I hope you find this helpful!

### Setting Up Git

Before diving into version control, you need to configure Git with your details. This ensures your commits are properly attributed to you.

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
```

### Creating and Cloning Repositories

Starting a new project? Initialize a new Git repository with:

```bash
git init
```

Or, if you want to work on an existing project, clone a repository using:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```

### Basic Snapshotting

To keep track of changes, you need to stage and commit them. Here are the basic commands:

```bash
git add <file>       # Stage a specific file
git add .            # Stage all changes in the current directory
git commit -m "Your commit message"  # Commit staged changes
```

You can always check the status of your repository with:

```bash
git status
```

And see the changes between your working directory and the staging area with:

```bash
git diff
```

### Branching and Merging

Branching allows you to work on features or fixes independently from the main codebase. Here's how you manage branches:

```bash
git branch                # List all local branches
git branch <branch_name>  # Create a new branch
git checkout <branch_name>  # Switch to a specific branch
git checkout -b <branch_name>  # Create and switch to a new branch
```

Once your work is ready, you can merge it back into the main branch:

```bash
git merge <branch_name>
```

If you need to delete a branch:

```bash
git branch -d <branch_name>   # Delete a branch
git branch -D <branch_name>   # Force delete a branch
```

### Working with Remote Repositories

Connecting your local repository to a remote one is crucial for collaboration:

```bash
git remote add origin <remote_url>  # Add a new remote repository
git fetch  # Download objects and refs from another repository
git pull   # Fetch and integrate changes from the remote repository
git push -u origin <branch_name>  # Push branch to the remote repository and set upstream
```

### Viewing Commit History

Keeping track of your project's history is simple with these commands:

```bash
git log            # Show commit logs
git log --oneline  # Show a condensed log of commits
git log --graph    # Show a graphical representation of commit history
```

### Undoing Changes

We all make mistakes. Here's how to undo changes:

```bash
git reset <file>     # Unstage a file
git reset --hard     # Reset working directory to the last commit
git revert <commit_id>  # Revert a commit by creating a new commit
```

### GitHub-Specific Commands

#### Forking Repositories

Forking a repository on GitHub creates a copy under your account. Just visit the repository page and click the "Fork" button.

#### Cloning Forked Repositories

After forking, you can clone your copy:

```bash
git clone <your_forked_repository_url>
```

#### Working with Pull Requests

Pull requests are essential for collaborating on GitHub. Here are some commands using the GitHub CLI:

```bash
gh pr create             # Create a new pull request
gh pr list               # List pull requests in the repository
gh pr view <pr_number>   # View a specific pull request
gh pr checkout <pr_number>  # Checkout the branch for a pull request
gh pr merge <pr_number>  # Merge a pull request
```

#### Managing Issues

Issues help track tasks, enhancements, and bugs. Use these commands with the GitHub CLI:

```bash
gh issue create          # Create a new issue
gh issue list            # List issues in the repository
gh issue view <issue_number>  # View a specific issue
```

### Advanced Git Commands

#### Stashing

Stash your changes to work on something else without committing:

```bash
git stash                # Stash changes
git stash list           # List all stashes
git stash apply <stash_id>  # Apply a specific stash
git stash pop            # Apply and remove the latest stash
```

#### Rebasing

Rebasing can streamline your commit history:

```bash
git rebase <branch>         # Reapply commits on top of another base tip
git rebase --abort          # Abort the rebase process
git rebase --continue       # Continue the rebase process after resolving conflicts
```

#### Tagging

Tags mark specific points in your commit history:

```bash
git tag <tag_name>          # Create a new tag
git tag                     # List all tags
git push origin <tag_name>  # Push a tag to the remote repository
```

### Conclusion

Learning Git and GitHub has been a rewarding journey for me. These tools have become indispensable for my version control and collaboration needs. Whether I'm working on solo projects or collaborating with others, mastering these commands has undoubtedly boosted my productivity and streamlined my workflow.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
